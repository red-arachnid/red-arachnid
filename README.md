## Hi there 👋

I'm Aniket, a Game Developer and Backend Engineer.

I focus on building immersive interactive experiences and robust systems. If there is a mechanic to be coded or an API to be built, I'm on it.

My main tech stack is **Unity** for game development and **C#** for scalable API/Backend architecture. On the creative side, I am a 3D artist using **Blender** to bring ideas to life.

I love bridging the gap between complex backend logic and engaging visual gameplay.

Currently open to new opportunities! Feel free to explore my repositories to see what I'm building.
